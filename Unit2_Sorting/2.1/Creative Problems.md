# 15.Expensive exchange. 
## A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of rearranging a number of large crates in order of the time they are to be shipped out. Thus, the cost of compares is very low (just look at the labels) relative to the cost of exchanges (move the crates). The warehouse is nearly full: there is extra space sufficient to hold any one of the crates, but not two. Which sorting method should the clerk use?
### **Solution:** Use selection sort because it minimizes the number of exchanges.
### 选择排序是交换次数最少的排序算法，当交换的开销很大时优先考虑
